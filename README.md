# Testing Node Js and Go performance for backend development

## This project folders contains

1. golang. It is a golang api using the Gin framework.
2. node-js. It is a Node Js api using the Express framework.
3. frontend. It is a basic Webpack frontend that connects to both api to perform sequential tests.
4. concurrency. It is a Node Js project that connects to both api to perform concurrent tests.

## Todo

This project right now it's only meant so you can check the code of the api and tests I have ran to investigate the performance difference between Node Js and Golang. As I get more time I will finish this project so anyone can install it and run it locally.
